------

Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes

Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry

I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before

Something is changing inside you and don't you know?

<br>

Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby

And don't you cry tonight

Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby

And don't you cry tonight

<br>

Give me a whisper and give me a sigh

Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye

Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad

I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby

<br>

And don't you cry tonight

Don't you cry tonight

Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby

And don't you cry tonight


<br>

And please remember that I never lied, oh
And please remember how I felt inside now, honey
You gotta make it your own way but you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow, come the morning light now, baby

<br>

And don't you cry tonight

Don't you cry tonight

Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby

And don't you cry

Don't you ever cry

Don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe someday

Don't you cry, don't you ever cry

Don't you cry tonight
